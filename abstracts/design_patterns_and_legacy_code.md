#Breaking down the problems in legacy apps before legacy apps break down

##Goals

##Summary
One of the frustrations of working in a legacy codebase is the lack of control over the architecture and design of the existing code especially when your tasked with keeping the old sucker running and not building or refactoring old features.

When you're trying to keep your old Toyota Rabbit on the road with some duct tape and luck it's tempting to throw quick fixes at it to keep it moving but this short changes both the buisness and the developer who's stuck on the side of the road trying to get the mufler from falling off. 

How can design patterns help us with legacy code? How can we be sure we're using the right tool for the right task? (cite Sandi Metz here) 

Here I'll give examples of how we've used a number of design patterns in our effort to keep our car on the road.
