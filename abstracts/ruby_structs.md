#A Dangerous Love Affair

##Goals

##Summary
Ruby classes are great! And when you work in Rails it's such a treat to get to write a PORO. 
So one day you're writing a ruby object because writing ruby objects is fun ... you start by writing a class
Then you're friend comes along and is like "psha! all the cool kids are using structs these days" so you're like
okay - I'll use a struct instead. So you make a struct and your program works AND you're cool.

Then, weeks later you go to use your struct and BLAMO! everything blows up.  

##Outline
Introduce the concept of a class
Introduce the concept of a struct
Show how I was tempted by structs
Show why that's bad
Lots of Gifs
