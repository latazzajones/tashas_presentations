#Accidental Open Source

##Goals


##Summary
One of the most common bits of advice I see for programmers who are just starting their careers or looking to change jobs is "Contribute to open source" and in all honesty I think that's the crulest thing you can tell someone. For years I felt pressure to become a contributer. I would find myself trying to make heads or tails of contribution guidelines for projects that interested me only to find that they frequently had few or no issues that I felt comfortable approaching. 

We shouldn't tell people to just wake up one day and "start contributing to opensource". Open source is about solving probems and the people who contribute are usually people who are affected by those problems. Being able to see the problems that need to be solved requires experience and exploration that takes time. 

Instead, we should be telling programmers to start thinking and exploring in ways that can set them up to become contributors. <- what does that look like? 

Uninformed contributions are not helpful. 

So - how does one think and explore in ways that set them up to become a maintainer or contributer? 

  * When you encounter a problem or obstical, explore higher-level solutions to that problem
  * Open issues with links to sample apps showing the bug when you find bugs in open source projects that other people maintain. 
  * Don't assume that someone else isn't already looking at the same problem. 
  * Don't assume that someone elses solution is the right one 

By training yourself to be a problem solver instead of a "Hacker" - you'll probably find yourself waking up one day merging contributions into a repo that you started because you built something to meet a need bigger than yourself.
