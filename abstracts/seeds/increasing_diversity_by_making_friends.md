#Increasing Diversity and Making Friends 

##Summary
Diversity and inclusion have been a hot topic for years. There are those who care, those who don't care and those who say they care. But - what if I were to tell you that there's only one thing you need to do to be a part of increasing diversity? What if I were to give you one task - one small and low commitment thing you can do during this conference that will make you a vital asset to any company looking to increase the diversity of their team. 

During the next x number of days, everytime you see someone in the room who doesn't look like you - who doesn't sound like you, go and chat with that person. Get his or her card and give them yours. Exchange twitter handles and add them to whatever twitter list you pay the most attention to. Follow THAT persons posts on Medium, follow THAT person's blog posts.

Rinse and repeat.

The audiance will leave this talk feeling more confident starting conversations with people who don't look like them. We'll review some very basic dos and don'ts of having conversation with people who don't look like you. We'll also talk about what an ally is and how allyship plays out in work environments.

Here's a little bit of advice about having your first conversation with someone who doesn't look like you.

*Do's 
  *Ask all the same questions you would ask of a new member that looks just like you
    *How did you hear about this event? 
    *Where do you work
    *What languages are you working in now
    *What kind of projects are you excited about these days?
    *Did you have to come from far?
    *How long have you been programming?
    *What did you think about the talks?
    *Find commonality
    *Parking around here sucks doesn't it?
    *The weather's so great today but I couldn't miss this great meetup.

*Dont's
  *Don't say "Hey! We're so glad you're here! We've never had a woman at our meetup before"
  *Don't say "You should talk to Rachel, she's a black woman too!"
  *Don't be the only one talking.
