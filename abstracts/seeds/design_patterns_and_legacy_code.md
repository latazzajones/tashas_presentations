#Breaking down the problems in legacy apps before legacy apps break down

##Goals

##Summary
When you're trying to keep your old VW Rabbit on the road with some duct tape and luck it's tempting to throw quick fixes at it to keep it moving. However, quick fixes short-change both the business and the developer who's stuck on the side of the road trying to keep the muffler from falling off.

What are some patterns that can help us continue building on a this type of codebase but also provide the continuous improvement it needs? How can we be sure we're using the right tool for the right task?

The aim of this talk is to explore some of these questions and talk about the realities of adopting legacy code
