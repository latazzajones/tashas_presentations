# Title: 
The law of Demeter deconstructed and in action

# Abstract: 
The Law of Demeter is one of the many tools in our arsenal for writing code that will withstand change into the future. It's also an invaluble tool for refactoring dense, tightly knit codebases to make them less brittle. However, the first few times I heard about it I ran away. 

This talk is aimed at devs like myself, who've avoided this tool because it felt too complex. We'll review the Law of Demeter, examining how law is broken as well as when and where it may look like the law is being broken even though it's not. The remainder of the talk will focus on practical examples of classes that are breaking the law and how we can refactor them to be more independant and reliable.
