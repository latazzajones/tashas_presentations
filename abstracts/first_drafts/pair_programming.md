# Title: 
A Framework for Pairing 

# Abstract: 
A lack of clarity and structure can increase resistance to pair programming on any team.  One of the issues with pair programming is that people confuse it for "talking to each other about a problem". While that is one aspect of pairing, there is a framework that can ensure that every memeber of the pairing session is engaged and gaining something from the experience. 

This talk will outline groundrules, pairing roles, pairing variations based on experience level, and pairing patterns to decrease the stress of pairing and optimise pairing for all that it has to offer your team.

While the perspective of this talk is from that of a fully distributed team, this framework can be applied to any pair programming situation. 


# Summary/outline: 
Groundrules: 
1. Respect each other’s timezones - This means if it one team member’s lunchtime, they take their lunch. If it is 6pm where you currently are, you are done for the day. This makes remote pairing both enjoyable and sustainable
1. Takes breaks - Play a remote game online for 5 minutes as opposed to a ping-pong game. Talk to your pair and get to know them. Getting to know your team member at a personal level makes pairing with them that much more enjoyable.
1. Decide which pairing pattern you’re using before you start your session. 
1. Take turns deciding on the pattern
1. Decide who is driving and for how long before you start the session. 

Pairing Roles: 
1. Driver 
1. Navigator/navigators

Pairing Variations: 
1. Expert–expert: Expert–expert pairing may seem to be the obvious choice for the highest productivity and can produce great results, but it often yields little insight into new ways to solve problems, as both parties are unlikely to question established practices.
1. Expert–novice: Expert–novice pairing creates many opportunities for the expert to mentor the novice. This pairing can also introduce new ideas, as the novice is more likely to question established practices. The expert, now required to explain established practices, is also more likely to question them. However, in this pairing, an intimidated novice may passively "watch the master" and hesitate to participate meaningfully. Also, some experts may not have the patience needed to allow constructive novice participation.
1. Novice–novice: Novice–novice pairing can produce results significantly better than two novices working independently, although, this practice is generally discouraged.
1. Mob: Diverse group of mixed skill level. 

Pairing Patterns: 
1. Ping Pong 
1. Who is this good for (from variations)?
1. Who should avoid this?
1. Who drives and who navigates?
