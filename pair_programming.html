          - Respect each other‚Äôs timezones
          
            If it one team member‚Äôs lunchtime, they take their lunch.   
            If it is 6pm where you currently are, you are done for the day.   
            This makes remote pairing both enjoyable and sustainable

         - Takes breaks
          
          Play a remote game online for 5 minutes as opposed to a ping-pong game.  
          Talk to your pair and get to know them.  
          Getting to know your team member at a personal level makes pairing with them that much more enjoyable.

          Strengths: 
            
            - High productivity 
            - Can lead to more efficiant and higher quality work.
            - Allows for both developers to spur off and explore different appraoches to solving the problem when at a decision making crossroad.

        <section data-markdown>
          Weaknesses: 

            - Rarely leads to new-innovative approaches to problems since both parties are less likely to question the norms of the framework or codebase

        <section data-markdown>
          Additional Groundrules:

            - RESPECT

			</div>
		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Strengths: 
          
            - A novice is more likely to question patterns and norms.
            - The expert is more likely to question established patterns when they have to explain those patterns to the novice
            - Provides opportunity for learning about the tools or domain for the novice.
            - Forces the expert to slow down and produce better quality work.
        </section>
			</div>
		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Weaknesses: 

            - Extra caution and empathy is required of the expert to ensure that the mentor doesn't end up passivly watching.
            - Can feel slower for the expert.
        </section>
			</div>
		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Additional Groundrules: 
            
            - The novice must be driving for the bulk of the time.
            - The expert SHOULD NOT do side research. Instead the expert should tell the novice where to look if documents are needed for reference.

        <section data-markdown>
          Strengths: 

            - Will significantly increase the capabilities of the two for solving problems outside of their existing skill set.
            - Prevents the novices from feeling stuck or trapped in a task outside of their skill set.
            - Allows for time for the expert to have a mental break or work on other tasks as needed.

		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Weaknesses: 

            - The resulting work needs careful review.
            - Can reinforce bad habbits without an expert present asynchronously.
        </section>
			</div>
		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Additional Groundrules: 

            - An expert must be present asynchronously and available for review + asking question. 
            - The novices must take turns driving
            - Empathy is required of both novices to prevent one from passivly watching.

          Strengths: 

            - Very effective when approaching large architectural issues in a codebase everyone is familiar with.

			</div>
		  <div class="slides">
        <section data-markdown>
          Additional Groundrules: 

            - Teams should determin communication patterns and channels in advance. 
            - Should be done in person or via video share
            - The most novice members of the group should drive.

          Some final bits of advice:

            - Pair programming doesn't need to happen 100% of the time
              (my sweet spot is 4-8 hours per week and less than 3 hour at a time)
            - Pair programming requires PRACTICE!!
            - It also requires kindness, introspection and empathy.
